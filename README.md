---

## 🚧 Project Status: Work in Progress

This repository currently contains only the **initial scaffold** of the project (backend, frontend, and blockchain directories). The goal is to build a complete decentralized system as described below.

---

## 🧠 Motivation

This project was born after witnessing **serious online bullying**, where individuals with no accountability used social media platforms to **target and harass respectable families**. The sheer **vulgarity, hate, and boldness** of these actions—done with **cheap audacity and zero consequences**—made it clear that current moderation systems are not enough.

There needs to be a **fair, transparent, and scalable solution** that gives power back to users while maintaining ethical standards.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To build a **multi-agent, AI-driven decentralized courtroom system** that integrates directly with social media via a web extension and enforces accountability through blockchain.

## 🔍 Vision Overview

- Users flag harmful content via a **browser extension**.
- A **courtroom simulation** begins with AI agents acting as **lawyers, judge, and jury**.
- Real-time deliberation and voting are conducted using **LLMs** and **Firestore**.
- Verdicts are stored on-chain, with **ETH/MATIC penalties or compensations** issued to offenders or victims.
- A **social score** system is used to track user behavior over time.
